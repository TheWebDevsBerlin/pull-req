 <hr>
Pull-request is a collaboration platform that allows users to browse GitHub repositories and connect with the owner to offer assistance on their project.
 <br><br>

>"Pull-request is like a dating app-except you end up working with your matches instead of sleeping with them." - User
 
 
The app only displays projects labeled as <strong>'Help Wanted'</strong> to encourage this collaboration.


## How it works 
The UI is similar to dating app designs in that the homepage is populated with potential matches that the user interacts with via by swiping. Once the user finds a project they would like to collaborate on they send a message, or "Pull-request", to the owner. This message arrives as a comment on the GitHub repo issue page and contains a custom URL that directs the repo owner to a chat session with our original user in the Pull-request app.  
 
Once the project owner accepts the pull-request, the two users are merged and the journey can begin ‚ù£Ô∏è
