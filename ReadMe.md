 <hr>
Pull-request is a collaboration platform that allows users to browse GitHub repositories and connect with the owner to offer assistance on their project.

>"Pull-request is like a dating app-except you end up working with your matches instead of sleeping with them." - User
 
 
The app only displays projects labeled as <strong>'Help Wanted'</strong> to encourage this collaboration.

## How it works 
The UI is similar to dating app designs in that the homepage is populated with potential matches that the user can interact with via a swipe interface. Once the user finds a project they would like to collaborate on they send a message, or "Pull-request", to the owner. This message arrives as a comment on the GitHub repo issue page and contains a custom URL that directs the repo owner to a chat session with our original user in the Pull-request app.  
 
Once the project owner accepts the pull-request, the two users are merged and the journey can begin ‚ù£Ô∏è
